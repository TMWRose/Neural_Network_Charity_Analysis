# Neural_Network_Charity_Analysis

## Overview

In this module we helped Becks, a data scientist and programmer for the nonproft foundation Alphabet Soup, analyze data to find high risk organizations the company shouldn't donate to. We used a deep learning neural network to analyze all inputs to produce a mathmatically sound decision. 

## Results

### Data Preprocessing

1. **What variable(s) are considered the target(s) for your model?**

  - 
  
2. **What variable(s) are considered to be the features for your model?**

  - 
  
3. **What variable(s) are neither targets nor features, and should be removed from the input data?**

  - 
  
### Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model

1. **How many neurons, layers, and activation functions did you select for your neural network model, and why?**

  - 
  
2. **Were you able to achieve the target model performance?**

  - 
  
3. **What steps did you take to try and increase model performance?**
